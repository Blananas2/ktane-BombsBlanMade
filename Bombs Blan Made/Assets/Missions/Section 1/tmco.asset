  Description: "You're walking in the woods. There's no one around and your phone
    is dead. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him: Shia LaBeouf. He's following
    you, about thirty feet back. He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint.
    He's gaining on you. Shia LaBeouf. You're looking for your car but you're all
    turned around. He's almost upon you now, and you can see... There's blood on his
    face. My God, there's blood everywhere! Running for your life from Shia LaBeouf.
    He's brandishing a knife, it's Shia LaBeouf Lurking in the shadows. Hollywood
    superstar Shia LaBeouf.\n[Revision Helper] Does the manual for <i>Color Morse</i>
